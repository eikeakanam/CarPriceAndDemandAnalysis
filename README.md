Objective: This project seeks to perform an exploratory analysis on car prices and demand in England, considering both pre and post Brexit periods, as well as different seasons. The primary objective is to uncover insights into the relationships among car prices, demand, and the impacts of Brexit and seasonal fluctuations.

The project involves the following steps:
Data Collection: Data was collected from Auto Trader for the years ending in 2022, encompassing various features such as Car Make, Model, condition, fuel type, body type, colour, registration code, year, and the target variable Price.

Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing of the collected data, dealing with missing values, outliers and Noise and ensured data consistency and reliability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comppehensive EDA to understand the distributions, patterns, and trends in car prices and demand and explored the impact of Brexit and seasonal variations on these factors. These includes obtaining descriptive statistics of relevant features and the target (price), analyze the frequency distribution and unique values of categorical features like Car Make, Model, condition, fuel type, body type, and colour.

Feature Engineering: Derived new features from the existing ones, including computing car age and classification, mileage rating, price scale, registration season using reg code, Brexit Index (Pre | Post) etc.

Data Visualization: Created visual representations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts to explore the impact of Brexit and Seasonal changes on the average price and volume of cars sold registered.

Report: 
aThe analysis reveals that, on average, car prices in England witnessed an increase after Brexit compared to the pre-Brexit period, based on data from the last two years before and after Brexit. This indicates a general upward trend in car prices, possibly due to factors such as changes in economic conditions, market dynamics, or supply and demand factors. Additionally, it was observed that there were higher car sales before Brexit compared to the post-Brexit period, using the specified years.

Regarding the impact of seasons on car prices, the analysis indicates that the average prices of cars registered during the spring/summer season were higher than those registered during the autumn/winter season. This disparity in prices can be attributed to various factors such as increased demand during the warmer months, potentially driven by factors like vacations, better driving conditions, or new model releases. Furthermore, it was found that more cars were registered during the spring/summer season compared to the autumn/winter season, suggesting a seasonal preference for car registration.
